# Twitter Election Integrity Data Exploration

A set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating pre-processing pipelines which provide a foundation for application of further analysis. Contains utility procedures for correct handling of data types, cleaning tweet and user bio text strings, and querying dataset for relevant subsets of tweets. These notebooks also show basic usage in data exploration, retrieving summary statistics and visualizing different patterns and distributions.

# To Do

- More extensive plotting and visualization - multiple queries on same axis, etc.
- Compare campaign-associated tweets against a baseline of a more general set of tweets from the same time periods
- Cross-campaign analysis
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g. k-means) to users and tweets
- Use a more complex algorithm such as BERT for tokenizing tweet text
- Add SQL database import/export
- Interface with deep learning library APIs
